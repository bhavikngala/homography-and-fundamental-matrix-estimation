% function used to detect features on a image
% TODO: should take type of features to detect as user input.
% For now perform SURF feature detection and return [rows, cols]

% ouput should return neighbourhood size along with keypoints

    neighbourhoodSize = (2 * radius + 1) * ones([size(rows, 1), 1]);
